### What do I do

####Short Answer:
Embedded Software Engineer

####Long answer:
*\[I'm sure there are some people in the world whose job title adequately conveys the full subtlety of what they do, but I don't think I've ever met any\]*

- Design of embedded systems
- Software architecture design
- Communications protocols, wired and wireless
- Networking
- Build systems and tooling
- Embedded software, use and design real time operating systems etc.

####Even Longer answer:
I took a fairly late u-turn from a University background in hardware into a professional world of software. This actually worked out rather well in equipping me for proper embedded software engineering. If you want to understand how a full embedded system works, you need to understand both the hardware and the software and how they interact. Some of the most 'fun' problems require you to debug your code with an oscilloscope (this is a special new meaning of the work 'fun')

I started out at Cambridge Consultants, doing a lot of wireless comms type work - protocol design and implementation, a lot of it based around Bluetooth. There's nothing like maintaining a million lines of C in the form of a protocol stack to teach you good software engineering practice.

For some reason or other I moved to PA Consulting and branched out a bit. The same cross discipline understanding that had previously resulted in me getting the interesting bugs, now also had me talking more about the larger system and how it should be designed.

The jobs have been mostly been in the area of 'Defence and Security', which is a whole different kettle of fish from commercial jobs. The motivations are very different, a lot more is needed in the way of V&V (yay, paperwork!). Less obviously, because these are expensive development jobs for a relatively low volume (1000 is the upper end), bill of materials cost for a unit is usually secondary to development cost. This is good fun in one sense, because you get to put all the cool toys in - if you want the giant FPGA then you can have it. On the other hand, it is usually easier to put in a larger processor than it is to optimise your code, and making your code that little bit quicker or smaller can be a source of good fun and interesting technical challenges.

I do a lot of C, more recently some C++. Where possible I use Python (much as I like C, I don't think there's a good excuse for using it on anything bigger than a microcontroller). I've written some assembly language, as and when. I've even reluctantly done some Matlab. When I couldn't find a hardware engineer I've written VHDL, I have a disturbing love of Makefiles, and I'm trying to learn Haskell. Oh, and look, I'm trying a bit of web stuff.

Outside work, I live in Cambridge (UK - just to be clear). The usual battle is to resist the relentless, black hole style, pull of rowing to give me some free time to Rock Climb and, you know, go to the pub and stuff. As always, we'll see how well this works out come Bumps season.
